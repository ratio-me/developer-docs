# Client Dashboard

## Introduction

After a client has gone live with their Ratio integration, they will obtain access to a Client Dashboard that provides reporting on Users, Transactions and the Acquisition Funnel. Clients will receive reporting on a bi-weekly basis from when they go live.



## Getting Access

The Client Dashboard is currently in private beta. Once you have gone live with your Ratio integration, you will be sent further instructions through Slack on how you can gain access to the Client Dashboard to get reporting on your Ratio integration.
