# Transactional Emails

## Overview

We will occasionally need to send end-users transactional emails, in order to keep them informed of important account-related updates, such as when their account application has been approved or a transaction has occurred.

Our emails are designed to communicate trusted interactions taking place directly with Ratio. As always our goal is to support your relationship with end users.

Here is a comprehensive description of the transactional emails we send and the reason for each.

### Email Verification

To ensure secure and reliable communication, as well as facilitate account recovery, we require users to verify their email.&#x20;

### KYC Approved

To notify users when their account application has been successfully approved and is ready for use.&#x20;

This ensures that the subset of users who may experience delayed approval are notified as soon as their account is approved.

### Order Submitted - Standard ACH

Sent each time a user initiates an ACH transaction that will be processed using the standard settlement time.

### Order Complete - Standard & Instant ACH

Sent each time a user's crypto transaction is broadcast on the network.

### Order Failed

Sent in the event that a user's crypto transaction fails to settle on-chain.  This is extremely rare.
