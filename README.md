# What is Ratio?

## Ratio

Crypto businesses use Ratio to embed fiat payments deep into their user experience. Ratio helps you on/off ramp funds, buy any token using a bank account, and enable fiat payment methods for your NFT marketplace.&#x20;

## Why Use Ratio?

Interacting with fiat payment rails is challenging. Most crypto teams don't have the experience or desire to build and operate fiat payment execution, risk, and compliance systems.

### Developer-focused Tooling

We provide a variety of tools, including full API access, so that you can build at whatever layer of the stack makes sense for your application.  We provide a sensible level of abstraction from the underlying concerns of payment execution, risk, and compliance, so that you can focus on building fiat payments deep into your user experience.&#x20;

### Intelligent Payment Routing

#### Local Payment Rails

The #1 issue with fiat on/off ramping is that most providers rely on card networks to process payments.  Card networks are incompatible with crypto on/off ramping because card issuers have the authority to block crypto purchases. Crypto purchases with credit and debit cards fail \~60% of the time.&#x20;

Ratio uses local payment rails (starting with ACH in the United States) to enable on/off ramping with authorization rates over 99%.

#### Visa/Mastercard

While the Visa/Mastercard networks are not a reliable method of payment for on/off ramping; they are still a reliable way to accept fiat payments for digital goods. Ratio has partnered with Checkout.com to enable NFT marketplace payments at authorization rates over 84%. This product will be in private beta in June. Contact us to learn more.
