# What We Do

## Ratio

Product teams use Ratio to embed fiat payments and deep into their user experience&#x20;

## Why Use Ratio?

Interacting with fiat payment rails is challenging. Most crypto teams don't have the experience or desire to build and operate fiat payment execution, risk, and compliance systems.

### User Experience

84% of users complete KYC in less than 2 minutes and are instantly approved.

Transaction success rates are over 98%.  More than double the average success rate (42%) of card-based onramps.

### Developer Experience

Our SDKs and API give you the flexibility to prioritize speed, customization, or some combination of the two.
