# React JS (Beta)

RatioKit includes a `RatioButton` component that requires a few parameters. This component allows for a few customizations so that it can be placed anywhere within your app.

Below is a sample of what the `RatioButton` component looks like by default

When RatioKit is generally available, we will open source it so that it can be styled to fit seamlessly into any UI/UX.&#x20;

## Requirements

To use the SDK you must first acquire a `clientId` and `clientSecret` from the Ratio team. Learn how to request API keys [here](<../../README (1).md#requesting-access>).

Ratio will provide an API that you will be required to wrap in your own back end (see example)
