## The v1.1 user flow is going live at the end of March.  We suggest referencing this flow when designing a white label integration. &#x20;

* There are no breaking changes
* The purpose of v1.1 is to make Standard ACH (3 business day settlement) the default, and allowing users to pay 3% in order to make their transaction instant.
